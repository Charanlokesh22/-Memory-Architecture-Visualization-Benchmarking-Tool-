 Memory Architecture Visualization & Benchmarking Tool

 Overview
This Python-based simulation tool is designed to analyze and benchmark different memory architectures and access patterns. It enables system architects to compare performance metrics, model caching effects, and visualize access latency under various configurations.

Features
- Simulates various memory hierarchies
- Configurable cache size, associativity, and replacement policies
- Latency modeling for different memory types
- Multi-threaded performance benchmarking
- Real-time data visualization with Matplotlib
- Exportable performance reports

 Tech Stack
- Python
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Multi-threading
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
